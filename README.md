## Inspiration

In my project 1 I was able to create a mini fantasy RPG game and I always looked back with hopes of having time to polish it up using new learned skills and frameworks.
Blacktop Capstone project is an upgraded versions of OOP oriented sandbox game with elements of basketball and usage of PSQL database.
